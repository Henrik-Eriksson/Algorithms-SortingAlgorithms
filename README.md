# Algorithms-SortingAlgorithms

The "Algoritmer Lab" is a laboratory component of the Algorithms course (TAIK12) for Computer Engineering students. It focuses on understanding common sorting algorithms and their implementations in C, along with experiment planning and empirical evaluation of algorithms. Students work in groups to implement three types of sorting algorithms (e.g., Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and either Mergesort or Quicksort), add counters for critical operations, and generate different types of input data. They also conduct experiments with these algorithms, record results, and compare empirical data to theoretical complexity. The lab includes optional tasks like measuring execution time. Students must submit a report summarizing their findings, emphasizing the relationship between empirical results and theoretical algorithm complexities.
